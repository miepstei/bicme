# bicme - Bayesian Analysis of Ion-channels with Missed Events

This is code used in our recent paper **"Bayesian Statistical Inference in Ion-Channel Models with Exact Missed Event Correction"** that appeared in *Biophysical Journal in 2016* (doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2016.04.053), available [here](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(16)30450-7)

# Prequisites

1. Install the DCPROGS c++ library - this is a reimplementation of the Colquhoun & Hawkes likelihood calculation originally written in Fortran
2. A C++11 compiler installed.
3. Matlab 2014b installed.
4. An ability to compile mex functions using the command line. Examples are provided but may need some caressing to compile the mex functions so that they can be called in matlab

# Installation steps

1. Check out the following tagged release
2. Create output directories [TO BE COMPLETED]
2. Compile the mex functions
3. Run the tests

# To run the examples from the paper...[TO FOLLOW]
